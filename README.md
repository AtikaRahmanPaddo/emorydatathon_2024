# emorydatathon_2024 Session: End to End to Model Development & EDA to ICU Dataset

Please find two notebooks for the EDA and Model Development.
Also find the relevant paper where you will find a study, where the researchers developed an AI Clinician using reinforcement learning to improve sepsis treatment. The AI, trained on extensive patient data, provided more effective treatment recommendations than current practices, leading to lower mortality rates in validation tests.
